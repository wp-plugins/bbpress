This is bbPress, the WordPress plugin. It isn't stable yet, so use at your own risk!

== Description ==
This plugin is in the beginning stages of development. Download and use at your own risk.

bbPress is forum software with a twist from the creators of WordPress.

Have you ever been frustrated with forum or bulletin board software that was slow, bloated and always got your server hacked?

bbPress is focused on web standards, ease of use, ease of integration, and speed. Weâ€™re keeping things as small and light as possible while still allowing for great add on features through our extensive plugin system.

What does all that mean? bbPress is lean, mean and ready to take on any job you throw at it.
